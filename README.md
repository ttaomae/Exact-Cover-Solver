# Exact Cover Solver
This project is used to solve the [exact cover problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) using the [Dancing Links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) technique.

Polyomino tiling and the 3-dimensional analog involving polycubes are examples of exact cover problems. This project also provides the ability to solve user specified puzzles of those types as well as two specific polycube puzzles.
